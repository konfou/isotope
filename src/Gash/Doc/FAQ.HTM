<p>Q.What is Gash? <br>
A. A programming language.&nbsp; It also comes with an integrated
development environment complete with debugger, etc.</p>
<p>Q. What the @#$! do we need another language for?<br>
A. Well, C++ is a good powerful language, but its difficult to crank
out high-quality apps in C++ quickly.&nbsp; You could switch to one of
those other languages, but then you'd lose the power of C++.&nbsp; Gash
lets you develop apps in an easy language without making you leave C++.</p>
<p>Q. What do you mean by "<i>you don't have to leave C++ to use Gash</i>"?<br>
A. Gash can call your C++ methods and C++ can call your Gash
methods.&nbsp; You can crank out the apps quickly in Gash and still
write the functions you want in C++.</p>
<p>Q. What will it cost me?<br>
A. Nothing.&nbsp; Gash is free.&nbsp; And you can do whatever you want
with the programs you develop with Gash.</p>
<p>Q. Do I have to link some library to my C++ app?<br>
A. Yes.</p>
<p>Q. What license is Gash distributed by?<br>
A. The LGPL</p>
<p>Q. Does Gash do garbage collection?<br>
A. Yes.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; I said it was an easy language.</p>
<p>Q. Do I need to know C++ to use Gash?<br>
A. No.&nbsp; You can make apps in just Gash if you want.</p>
<p>Q. Do you want me to switch to Gash?<br>
A. "switching" is not necessary.&nbsp; Use whatever platform you
want.&nbsp; Gash is just a tool to make your life easier.&nbsp; If you
ever decide you don't like it anymore, it will compile back to C++
souce code so you can walk away unscathed.</p>
<p>Q. Does Gash run in a Virtual Machine or does it compile to x86
instructions?<br>
A. Whichever you want.&nbsp; The debugger uses the virtual
machine.&nbsp; The virtual machine is also there in case you want to
run apps off the net in a guaranteed safe environment.&nbsp; Compiled
x86 apps, however, will run very fast.</p>
<p>Q. How easy is it to develop Gash apps?<br>
A. The Gash IDE is 100% menu-based (not editor-based).&nbsp; That means
you never have to just <i><b>know</b></i> what to type.&nbsp; Your
choices are always before you.&nbsp; It will take you a while to get
used to--any new language would.&nbsp; But you will find out that Gash
is as easy as they get.</p>
<p>Q. Can I still edit the source in a text editor?<br>
A. Yes.&nbsp; The source is XML-based.</p>
