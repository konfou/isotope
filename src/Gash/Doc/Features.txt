Implicitness won't scale.  Why?  Because people have a limited ability/tolerance for
learning complicated systems.  Programming languages have become convoluted with
implicit things to the point that we can't make progress anymore.  It's hard to let
them go because they seem to make things easier.  But in the long run they make
progress much harder.  The trick is to make things simpler without making things
happen implicitly.  That way you can do more without having to learn more.  Thus
there are no constructors, overloadable operators, best-fit casts, automatic
string-izing, etc.
